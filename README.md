# About

## Summary

I made Desktop YouTube Music because I was tired of Spotify's bad performance, frequent advertisements, and bad suggestions.

I figured that since Google is one of the major companies trying to give you the best suggestions, that YouTube Music would be the way to go.

I used the web version for a while, but then I wondered if they had made a desktop app version like Spotify.

No, they hadn't. Why? I have no idea.

There are a couple user-made versions (excluding the one for Google Play Music, that's unrelated), but I thought I could do better.

I use [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) to make and modify the app, adding features that the community wants.

## Features

# Known Bugs

- It won't update! This is because I recently changed the name of the GitHub repository.
  - Make sure you download the latest working version of the app from the [releases](https://github.com/KyzaGitHub/Unofficial-Desktop-YouTube-Music/releases).
  
- Rarely, the installer fails to open because it is still locked by the automatic update downloader.
  - Just restart the app and try the update again.

## Linux support is here (mostly)!

It's easy! Just go to [releases](https://github.com/KyzaGitHub/Unofficial-Desktop-YouTube-Music/releases), expand `Assets`, and install the correct version for your computer. No macOS yet, sorry guys.
